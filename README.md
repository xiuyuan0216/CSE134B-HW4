the main page is the improved website from last HW. For nativedialog, custumdialog, and crud, my solution has the same function 
as in demo video, but looks different. For example, in crud, I make post title, date, summary in different lines to make them more similar
to real world blogs instead of putting them in one line. Plus, I put add button at the top of the page just below the heading instead of putting it after all posts because in that way users don't need to scroll down to add posts, which is more convenient.
