Improvement from last HW: 

I find a lot of problems from my last HW, so I make a lot of improvements based on these problems

1. My previous work does not choose color carefully. The website is completely white except some colors of texts. I carefully select the background color and make the whole website more colorful.

2. As it uses white background color, main and body are inseparable, which does not provide good visual clues about which part is more important. Therefore, I give body background and make main white. I make main part like floating on the body, which not only makes the website more beautiful, but also gives users intuitions about which part is important.

3. Previously, there is no clear dividing between each part. This time, I add clear dividing lines between different parts to add more contrast.

4. I add some cool effects to the website like text blurring.


Third party script:

I add Google Analytics to my website to track the visiting information of my website. As it is personal website, I believe it is very important to know who visits the website, which page they spend most time on, and what actions they take, which will be of great help in many aspects. You can find that I add the link in html. After I configure the Google Analytics, I visit the website from my phone and my laptop, and it does track the visiting information.
